# Pokemon Infinite Fusion

## Like

- The game's purpose is to let the player fuse any Pokemon. And it works pretty well!
- Johto and Sevii Islands visit. The game tries to show Johto 3 years before GSC and is succesful with it
- TMs are good and easy to access (Nasty Plot, ...)
- Custom battlers which brings immersion.
- In general, it's a really fun ride.
- Felt like a savior when I disabled Team Rocket fusion machine.

## Dislike

- Fused Pokemon are lost: when unfused, stats are randomized. This kind of make the game
unsuitable to play without Debug Mode to restore moves / EVs / IVs / natures.
- I think most fusions are actually unviable and found myself being crippled by most fusion I
tried. I ended up by using mostly non fusions (Alakazam, Nidoking) and only fusing Gengar with
quick special attackers (Mewtwo-Gengar, Zapdos-Gengar and Tyhplosion-Gengar).
  - even Ninetales-Typhlosion, wich in theory is a fast special attacker with Drought and Eruption
  felt kind of lackluster.
  - The stats average (even thought it is a 2/3 average) is actually a nerf to most (already optimzed)
  Pokemon, which means fusion is only good to expand the moveset, change the type and get access to
  new abilities. For example Slowbro + Dugtrio was like "hey you can make Slowbro fast or Dugtrio
  a special attacker": nope it becomes not bulky, not fast, and a weak attacker. Some Pokemon like
  Ampharos are just bad for fusion by design (slow special attacker = either get crippled by slow speed
  or don't use Ampharos special side)  
- When a fused pokemon level up, the same move can be learned several time (for exemple, Kyurem-100%
(Kyurem-Reshiram-Zekrom) form learns three time Ancient Power at the same level).
- "Mega Evolutions" don't get their Mega evolution Ability (I wanted to use Mega Beedril, nope it's as
weak as regular Beedril).

## Out of the scope of the game

- I won't expand much on this aspect, as the game clearly does not care about it, but fused Pokemon
feelings are never questionned.
- Breeding a fused Pokemon is also never questioned
  - Ditto + Gengar-Gengar gives a Gastly-Gastly egg, which can be unfused into two Gastly-s)
  - But Gengar + Weezing gives a Gastly egg, which is a missed opportunity to give a Gastly-Koffing egg.
- I think a game that would try to be serious would instead use the "egg way" (which is already kind of
used for triple fusion): Pokemon are Pokemon, and when bread, when give a fused Pokemon egg, or hybrids
Pokemons that can't be unfused. But that would obviously be less fun than spamming the DNA Splicer.
